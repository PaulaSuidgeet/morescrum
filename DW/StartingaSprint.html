			<div class="col-12">
				<p class="scrumsprint-text"><strong>A Sprint</strong> is a fixed-length iteration. These sprints are no more than 30 days long, preferably shorter. Scrum teams try to develop a potentially releasable, properly tested, product increment every sprint. Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12">
				<p class="scrumsprint-text">At the beginning of each Sprint, the Sprint Planning Meeting takes place. It is divided into two sub-meetings, which are called Sprint Planning Part One and Sprint Planning Part Two. Part One focuses on understanding what the Product Owner wants. In Sprint Planning Part One, the Product Owner and Team, with assistance from the ScrumMaster, review the high-priority items in the Product Backlog that the Product Owner is interested in carrying out this Sprint. They discuss the goals and context for these items on the Product Backlog, providing the Team with insight into the Product Owner’s thinking. The Product Owner and Team also review the definition of “Done” that all items must meet. At the end of Part One the Product Owner may leave but must remain reachable in case of questions or concerns during the next meeting. Of course, they are welcome to attend Part Two.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-12">
				<p class="scrumsprint-text">Sprint Planning Part Two focuses on detailed task planning for how to implement the items that the Team decides to take on. The Team selects the items from the Product Backlog they commit to complete by the end of the Sprint, starting at the top of the Product Backlog, the highest priority items, and working down the list in order. The Team decides how much work it will commit to complete, rather than having it assigned to them by the Product Owner. This makes for a more reliable commitment. While the Product Owner does not have control over how much the Team commits to, the items the Team is committing to are drawn from the top of the Product Backlog and thus rated as most important. The Sprint Planning Meeting will often last a number of hours, but no more than eight hours for a four-week Sprint. The Team will probably begin the 10 Sprint Planning Part Two by estimating how much time each member has for Sprint-related work and usually works out to be 4-6 hours per day available for Sprint-related work. </p>

			<h3 id="mainheaderburndown">Sprint Burndown chart</h3>
			<div class="col-12">
				<img src="images/Scrum_burndown_chart.png" alt="burndown chart" class="burndown-chart">
			  <p class="scrumburndownchart-text"><strong>A Burn-down Chart</strong> is a chart which shows the amount of work which is thought to remain in a backlog. Time is shown on the horizontal axis and work remaining on the vertical axis. As time progresses and items are drawn from the backlog and completed, a plot line showing work remaining may be expected to fall. The important thing is that it shows the Team their progress towards their goal, not in terms of how much time was spent in the past but in terms of how much work remains in the future. If the burndown line is not tracking downwards completion near the end of the Sprint, then the Team needs to adjust, such as to reduce the scope of the work or to find a way to work more efficiently while still maintaining a sustainable pace. Work remaining in Sprint Backlogs and Product Backlogs may be communicated by means of a burn-down chart.</p>
